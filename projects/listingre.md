## Project Overview

This project involved developing a linked list-based system for managing real estate listings in Java. The primary goal was to create an efficient and functional data structure capable of performing operations like adding, removing, and searching for houses based on MLS (Multiple Listing Service) numbers and various attributes. Additionally, the system needed to support printing listings filtered by criteria such as minimum price, maximum price, and price ranges. This project offered a practical opportunity to explore linked lists and object-oriented programming in Java, aimed at building a real-world application for managing house listings effectively.

## Role and Responsibilities

In this project, I was solely responsible for the entire development process. This role included designing and implementing essential components such as the HList class for managing the linked list, the HNode class for representing individual nodes, and the House class for modelling house data. I took charge of coding functionalities like adding and removing nodes, searching for houses by MLS numbers, and implementing various methods for filtering and printing listings based on different criteria. Adopting a modular approach, I created distinct classes and methods that facilitated easier maintenance and updates. This design strategy allowed me to handle edge cases robustly and ensure the system operated efficiently. My approach also included implementing thorough testing to guarantee that each functionality performed reliably under various scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Linked List Management**: Efficiently manages house listings using a linked list data structure.
- **Search and Filter**: Allows searching by MLS numbers and filtering listings by price criteria.
- **Modular Design**: Clearly defined classes for managing houses, nodes, and the linked list.

## Insights and Learnings


Working on this project gave me valuable insights into managing linked data structures and applying object-oriented principles in Java. I gained a deeper understanding of how to manage linked lists, including node insertion, deletion, and search operations effectively. The project emphasised the importance of robust error handling and method efficiency, demonstrating how critical it is to address edge cases to maintain system reliability. I also learnt the benefits of modular design, as breaking down the system into manageable components made development and maintenance more organised. This experience highlighted the practicality and importance of straightforward, criteria-based filtering for real-world applications and improved my skills in Java programming. Overall, the project has prepared me for tackling more complex data management challenges and has strengthened my ability to design scalable, efficient systems.

## Future Plans

- **Expand Features**: Plan to add more advanced filtering and search options based on user feedback.
- **Performance Optimisation**: Aim to optimise the system for handling larger datasets more efficiently.

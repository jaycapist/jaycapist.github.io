 Initially, I did not want to take the Computer Science pathway. However, things had changed.

## Evasion

 Truthfully, I did not want to do computer science, so I avoided it. It seemed too preordained; a 'techy' kid will grow into the 'techy' career. He fixed that computer, made that computer, likes video games, knows how to fix this and that, and so on. It was not my sole reason, but it was my primary reason for avoiding it; I did not want to fall into the stereotypical mould. However, I eventually decided that I needed something to do. Sure enough, I started to work towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

## Inevitable?

 I had never taken a CS class, so I naturally started with the 'Intro to Programming' classes. These courses were eye-opening. The process and achievement of solving a problem or task were more than gratifying. Quickly, I developed a deep appreciation for the methods and elegance of software development. What began as a reluctant choice soon became a genuine passion for problem-solving through code.

## Further Interests

 As I immersed myself in the subject, I discovered a few interests I look forward to immersing in. Database management, cloud platforms, data analytics, and data visualisation will become the focal points of my self-studies. My growing passion for these areas led me to explore data engineering as a pathway.

 Looking forward, I am excited about several ambitious projects that will allow me to apply and further develop my skills. I am working on KumuDex, a web app that organises Pok√©mon data with specialised filters, and a multi-language lyrics app to enhance music accessibility for non-native speakers. Additionally, I am developing a Japanese practise app featuring interactive exercises for language learning. These projects will represent an opportunity to integrate my interests in data engineering, cloud platforms, and software architecture. As I refine my skills and tackle new challenges, I am committed to my input into the scene of software engineering and now embracing the technology landscape.

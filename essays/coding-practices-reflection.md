## Linting

	Initially, I was intimidated by the idea of coding standards. I worried I would not be able to remember all the rules. However, as I started writing code, I found comfort in having a consistent set of guidelines. Rather than feeling restrictive, these standards provided a helpful framework that made coding easier.

## Understanding the Game

	When I first began coding, it felt similar to my childhood experience playing Yu-Gi-Oh, especially when tackling the puzzles where you had to figure out how to win in a given situation. There was so much to digest and parse, making both ESLint and Yu-Gi-Oh feel overwhelming. To efficiently resolve issues, you need to thoroughly understand the situation, which encouraged me to engage with coding standards practically. Although I favour these standards, adhering to them can be challenging. Each ESLint error felt like a knowledge check, serving as a reminder that I needed to grasp what I was doing to resolve issues efficiently. This process has been rewarding for my growth as a programmer, with each error corrected bringing me closer to greater familiarity and confidence in my skills.

## Team Incentive

    I have yet to use coding standards in collaboration with others; however, I am eager to see how they will affect our ability to work together. On paper, coding standards should keep the code clean and consistent, especially among multiple collaboratorsâ€”that is a significant reason to use them. I wonder about their impact on communication and understanding among team members working in tandem.

## Future Opportunities

    In ICS 311: Algorithms and Data Structures, we will eventually implement code in groups of up to three people. Although we may not all split the work on the code specifically, there will be opportunities to showcase these standards in practice. I look forward to those assignments, especially since many of my classmates are concurrently enrolled in Software Engineering I. For most, this will be our first experience using coding standards with ESLint in a collaborative effort, and I am excited to see how it shapes our teamwork.

## Applying ESLint

	What once felt intimidating is now comforting, as coding standards assist me in writing cleaner and more effective code. Each ESLint error I correct reinforces my understanding of the language and its best practices, significantly contributing to my growth. I am excited to see how these standards will enhance collaboration in group projects, making our code more consistent and improving communication among team members. Embracing coding standards has transformed my approach to coding, and I look forward to applying them as I continue developing my skills.
